<h1 align=center>3. Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h3>1.Technical Terms</h3>

<h4>1.1 Big Endian / Little Endian</h4>
There are two different models for storing a multiple byte number.&nbsp;
A processor using the big endian model (e.g Motorola 68k, PowerPC, Java VM) 
stores the
most significant byte first. In the little endian model (e.g. x86) the least 
significant byte is stored first in memory.
<br>
<i>
Example: Suppose you have the hex number 0x12345678. On a big endian processor
the number looks like this in memory: 0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78, whereas a little
endian processor stores the number like this 0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12.

<h4>1.2 Encoding negative numbers</h4>
<b>Two Complement</b><br>
The standard way to encode negative numbers is to use the two complement. 
A positive number has the most significant bit set to false, the other bits 
are used to encode the number.
<br>
A negative number has the most significant bit set to true, the other bits are 
used the encode the two complement of the number. You calculate the two 
complement of a number by doing a not on the number and adding one. By doing 
this on the whole number, including sign, you negate the number.
<br>
The reason for this rather complicated encoding is to make addition and 
subtraction easier. Instead of having to evaluate the sign 
bit and decide how to combine the two numbers, you can just do a binary 
addition. Subtraction is done by negating the second number before addition.
<i>
Example: Suppose we encode the range -128 to +127 in one byte. +15 is 
encoded 00001111 but -15 is encoded 11110001 and not 10001111. Now we negate 
-15 to get +15. First the not operation: 11110001 -> not -> 00001110 and then 
adding one: 00001110 -> +1 -> 00001111.
</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Bias</b><br>
You convert a biased number to a normal signed number by subtracting the bias.
<br>
<i>
Example: you have a byte with the value 240. The bias used for this encoding 
was 127 (the bias may
be choosen arbitrarily but for one byte 127 seem useful as it divides the byte 
into a similar
size positive and negative chunks). So the real number is 240 - 127 = +13.
e.g. The exponent in IEEE754 Floating Point Numbers is encoded using a bias
</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Sign Bit</b><br>
One bit in the number is declared as the sign bit. If this bit is negative the 
number is negative
and vice versa.
e.g. The mantisse in IEEE754 Floating Point Number is encoded using a sign bit.

<h3>2. Performance </h3>
<h4>2.1. General Tips</h4>
<ul>
<li>use few dynamic views with unlocked offset, as they are recompiled each time 
the offset changes</li>
<li>use small structure definitions, the bigger the definition the slower the editing</li>
<li>disable "Compile View" for structure definitions which you dont need at the moment</li>
</ul>

<h4> Editing the structure definitions takes very long because of the constant 
recompilation</h4>
Disable "Compile View" then enable it after you finished editing the structure definition.

<h4> Out of Memory </h4>
For editing large files you have to increase the maximal heap memory of the Java 
Virtual Machine. To set the maximal heap to 300MB in the standard JRE 1.4.0 
from Sun the commandLine option is: <i>java -Xmx300m -jar 
DataWorkshop.jar</i>. 

<h3>3. How do I .. ?</h3>

<h3>4. Common Problems </h3>
<h4>4.1 Structure definition is compiled incorrectly</h4>
Make sure the endianess of the structure corresponds to the endianess of the 
data you want to view. The endianess cannot be guessed by the programm and is 
not directly linked to the data.
In some cases the definition of the format mentions the endianess (e.g. Java 
class files are always BigEndian no matter on what processor java is run. The 
same is true for TCP/IP network traffic).

<h4>4.2 Crash on startup</h4>
Try deleting dataWorkshop.xml and editor.xml. These are configuration files 
for DataWorkshop which might be corrupted due to bugs in DataWorkshop. If they 
are not found at startup the are restored to their default values.

<h4>4.3 Cannot enter data in find and replace dialog</h4>
Below the find and replace data fields are two information bars displaying offset, range and size. 
The default size is 0, so no data is displayed in the field. If you change the size you will be able to enter data.

<h4>4.4 Cannot diff data, the "diff data" button in the dialog is disabled</h4>
The button only becomes enabled if the selection range in the two data sets has the same size.

<h4>4.5. While Editing the structure definition there are constantly freezes and crashes</h4>
I know this part of the code is quite unstable and I am working on it. 
<br>
One workaround is to disable the "Compile View" checkbox while you are still working on the structure definition
and then reenable the it after you are finished editing the structure definition.

<h3>5. Known Bugs </h3>
<h4>Look and Feels changes</h4>
Although it is possible to change the look and feel of DataWorkshop it it not advised. If you experience any
problems in the GUI swith to the default Metal Look and Feel.

<h3>6. Errors </h3>
<h4>Could not transform Data</h4>
