<h1 align=center>B. XML-Files</h1>

<p><b>WARNING</b></p>
<i>
Even though the data files are in xml and should be easy to 
understand and modify it is nonetheless possible to corrupt them.
If you corrupt dataWorkshop.xml or editor.xml DataWorkshop may crash on 
startup. 
In this case delete them, they will be restored to their default value next 
time you exit DataWorkshop.
</i>

<p>
All data in DataWorkshop (e.g options, structures etc.) is saved as 
xml-tagged text. Some of the xml files are automatically created by the editor 
(e.g. structures), others can be configured using the editor. But for the 
power user it might be useful to edit the xml files by hand.
<br>
To make the most of the following sections the reader should be familiar with 
xml. But even if he has no clue about xml he should be able to make some basic 
changes to the files just by looking at the structure. This 
is the beauty of xml.
<br>
For more indepth information you should consult the corresponding DTDs.
